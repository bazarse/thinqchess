          contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS
          ACTION WAIVER.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes in
          connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service
          provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small
          claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual
          basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise
          agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This
          Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any
          subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
          successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized
          users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either
          party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other
          party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of
          the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the
          Company should be sent to: SNN Raj Serenity, Begur Koppa Road,
          Bangalore -560068, India. After the Notice is received, you and the
          Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you
          and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30)
          days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
          arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any
          party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
          arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either
          party is entitled.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator
          will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and the
          dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with
          any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
          grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator
          shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any
          non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
          applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall
          issue a written award and statement of decision describing the
          essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The
          arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual
          basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the
          arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be
          strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality
          unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a
          party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to
          enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek
          injunctive or equitable relief.

        <p className="mt-4">
          Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are
          found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
          competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of
          no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the
          Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
